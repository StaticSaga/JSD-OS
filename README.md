# JSD/OS
A small operating system for 32 bit x86

## What does JSD/OS stand for

The actual meaning of the acronym is intentionally ambigous but might stand for one of "**J**ake **S**. **D**el Mastro **O**perating **S**ystem" or "**J**ake'**S** **D**isk **O**perating **S**ystem" or maybe even "**J**ake'sÂ **S**oftware **D**istribution **O**perating **S**ystem" or finally "**J**ava**S**cript is **D**isallowed **O**perating **S**ystem"
